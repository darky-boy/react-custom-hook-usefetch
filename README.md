# Task 5 – React Custom Hook (useFetch)

This project is created as part of Task 5 for the MERN Stack course.

In this project, a custom React hook called `useFetch` is used to fetch data from an external API and handle loading and error states.

## How to Run Locally

## Description
The `useFetch` hook takes a URL as input and returns data, loading, and error values.  
This makes API fetching reusable and clean.
